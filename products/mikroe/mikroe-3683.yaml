description: "eINK Click is an adapter Click board\u2122, used to interface a compatible\
  \ eINK display with the host MCU. The most distinctive feature of the eINK displays\
  \ is their very low power consumption and the ability to retain the information,\
  \ even after disconnecting from the power source. The power is consumed only when\
  \ the display content is changing."
