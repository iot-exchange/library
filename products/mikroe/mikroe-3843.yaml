description: MCU Card is a standardized add-on board, which allows very simple installation
  and replacement of the microcontroller unit (MCU) on a development board equipped
  with the MCU Card socket. By introducing the new MCU Card standard, we have ensured
  the absolute compatibility between the development board and any of the supported
  MCUs, regardless of their pin configuration.
