description: DC MOTOR 14 Click is a PWM chopper type brushed DC motor driver, labeled
  as TB67H450AFNG, produced by Toshiba. This IC includes one channel of motor output
  block, using a wide range of supply voltages, while delivering reasonably high current
  to the connected DC motors. Low ON-resistance MOSFETs and a PWM control help the
  TB67H450AFNG exhibit lower heat...
