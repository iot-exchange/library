description: "AN to PWM Click is a device that converts the value of the input analog\
  \ signal with virtually any wave shape to a fixed frequency PWM voltage output,\
  \ with a duty cycle proportional to the input voltage. It has a linear response,\
  \ and by applying a signal with the voltage between -2.5V to +2.5V on its input,\
  \ the Click board\u2122 will generate a pulse width..."
