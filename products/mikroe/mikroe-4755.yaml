description: Current 4 Click is a compact add-on board that provides a precise and
  accurate current sensing solution. This board features the INA250, a bidirectional,
  zero-drift current-shunt monitor from Texas Instruments. This voltage-output, current-sensing
  amplifier measures the voltage developed across the internal current-sensing resistor
  when current passes...
