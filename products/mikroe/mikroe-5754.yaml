description: Step Down 7 Click is a compact add-on board that converts higher voltages
  into a lower voltages level. This board features the MAX17624, a synchronous step-down
  converter with integrated MOSFETs from Analog Devices. The converter, as input,
  uses voltages in the range from 2.9V up to 5.5V and can output step-down voltages
  from 1.5V to 3.3V up to 1A. It...
