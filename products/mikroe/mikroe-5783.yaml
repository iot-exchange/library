description: Nano Power 3 Click is a compact add-on board that steps down voltages
  from its input (supply) to output (load). This board features the RPL-3.0-R, a buck
  converter with an integrated inductor from Recom Power. This thermally-enhanced
  converter uses, as input, voltage from 4 up to 18VDC, thus allowing 5V and 12V supply
  rails to be used.
