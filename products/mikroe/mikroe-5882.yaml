description: Charger 26 Click is a compact add-on board that provides a single-cell
  charging solution. This board features the MAX1811, a USB-powered Li+ charger from
  Analog Devices. The charger uses an internal FET to deliver the battery up to 500mA
  charging current. It has pre-conditioning that soft-starts a near-dead battery cell
  before charging.
