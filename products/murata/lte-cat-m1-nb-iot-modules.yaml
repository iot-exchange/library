description: "Murata has designed the world\u2019s smallest LTE Cat.M1/NB-IoT module.\
  \ It has a global certification and supports GPS/GNSS, OpenMCU, and iSIM (option).\
  \ LTE Cat.M1 (LTE-M) features high reliability, low latency, and low power consumption.\
  \ It can be used in IoT devices that require battery replacement. NB-IoT is expected\
  \ to be used for IoT solutions that require low power consumption, and is suitable\
  \ for environments where batteries are not easily replaceable or where a commercial\
  \ power supply is unavailable such as on smart meters and other remote medical examinations\
  \ or anomaly detection when disasters occur."
