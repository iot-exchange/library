description: This module is based on the I2C light-to-digital converter TSL2561 to
  transform light intensity into a digital signal. It has three detection modes to
  take your readings (infrared mode, full-spectrum, and human visible mode) and can
  be used to measure the change in light intensity in various light situations with
  many popular microcontrollers.
