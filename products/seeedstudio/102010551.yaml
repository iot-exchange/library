description: "The XIAO RA4M1 integrates Renesas' RA4M1 chip (32-bit ARM\xAE Cortex\xAE\
  -M4 MCU up to 48 MHz with FPU) into the classic XIAO form factor. This development\
  \ board offers 256KB Flash, 32KB SRAM, 8KB EEPROM, a USB 2.0 connector, reset and\
  \ boot buttons, 3 LEDs, a 14-bit A/D converter, a 12-bit D/A converter, and a CAN\
  \ BUS interface. With onboard charging circuitry and low-power modes (as low as\
  \ 45\u03BCA), it\u2019s ideal for battery-powered applications. Sharing the same\
  \ 32-bit microcontroller as the Arduino Uno R4, it's natively compatible with Arduino\
  \ IDE, making it the perfect starting point for electronics projects thanks to the\
  \ extensive XIAO accessories."
