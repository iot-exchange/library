description: WT32-ETH01 is an embedded serial to Ethernet module based on the ESP32
  series WT32-S1 MCU. The module integrates an optimized TCP/IP protocol stack, which
  is convenient for users to easily complete the networking functions of embedded
  devices while reducing development time cost. In addition, the module is compatible
  with half-pad and through-hole connectors. The board width is a universal width
  and therefore, it can be directly soldered to boards, connectors, or even breadboards,
  which is convenient for users to use in different scenarios.
