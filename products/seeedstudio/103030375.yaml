description: The Arduino Sensor Kit is a joint electronics starter kit from Seeed
  and Arduino. It integrates 10 commonly used electronics modules on one PCB, so no
  breadboard, no soldering, and even no wiring are required. The Arduino content team
  has also prepared a step-by-step tutorial for this kit. All these features make
  it an ideal Arduino starter kit for Steam education and online teaching.
