description: Jetson Mate Cluster Mini includes a Jetson Mate, a cooling fan, and a
  case. Jetson Mate is a carrier board which can install up to 4 Nvidia Jetson Nano/NX
  SoMs. There is an on board 5-port gigabit switch enabling the 4 SoMs to communicate
  with each other. All the 3 peripheral SoMs can be powered on or off separately.
  With a 65W 2-Port PD charger, for Jetson Nano SoMs or a 90W 2-Port PD charger for
  Jetson NX SoMs and one ethernet cable, developers can easily build their own Jetson
  Cluster.
