description: Raspberry Pi Debug Probe is a complete plug-and-play interface debug
  solution perfect for Raspberry Pi Pico, XIAO RP2040, other RP2040-based microcontrollers,
  and microprocessor-based platforms. It bridges the USB interface to a dedicated
  serial debug interface and industry-standard UART interface, both of which use a
  small, keyed, 3-pin debug connector, published for the next standard.
