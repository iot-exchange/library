description: With the STEM ranging bundle, you get everything you need for scripting
  and learning how to operate a robot in 3 dimensions and react to objects around
  it. We supply an easy-to-use Python API where you can use commands like "move forward
  1 meter", program paths the Crazyflie will follow and "measure distance to the right".
  You will also get access to the full logging framework where you easily can read
  telemetry and measurement data.
