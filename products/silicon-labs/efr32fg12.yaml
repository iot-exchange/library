description: EFR32FG12 wireless solutions combine an energy-friendly microcontroller
  (MCU) with a highly integrated radio transceiver supporting sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz
  proprietary wireless protocols and proprietary modulation schemes including OOK,
  shaped FSK, shaped OQPSK with DSSS, with and without FEC. Our solution provides
  industry-leading energy efficiency, ultra-fast wakeup times, a scalable power amplifier,
  an integrated 2.4 GHz balun and extensive MCU features. The devices are well suited
  for any battery-operated application and other systems requiring high performance
  and low energy consumption.
