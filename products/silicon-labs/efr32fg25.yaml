description: "EFR32FG25 wireless SoCs are an ideal solution for long range, Sub-GHz\
  \ wireless connectivity for smart metering, lighting, city and building automation.\
  \ The inclusion of multi-rate OFDM, FSK, and O-QPSK modulation schemes allows for\
  \ data rates up to 3.6 Mbps while keeping immunity to 2.4 GHz interference. The\
  \ large memory footprint and increased IO count allows for design consolidation\
  \ and when combined with Secure Vault\u2122 can provide higher level system security."
