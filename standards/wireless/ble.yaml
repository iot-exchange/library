name: Bluetooth low energy
description: |
  The Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) radio is designed for very low power operation. 
  Transmitting data over 40 channels in the 2.4GHz unlicensed ISM frequency band, the Bluetooth LE radio provides 
  developers a tremendous amount of flexibility to build products that meet the unique connectivity requirements of 
  their market. 
  
  Bluetooth LE supports multiple communication topologies, expanding from point-to-point to broadcast and, 
  most recently, mesh, enabling Bluetooth technology to support the creation of reliable, large-scale device networks. 
  While initially known for its device communications capabilities, Bluetooth LE is now also widely used as a device 
  positioning technology to address the increasing demand for high accuracy indoor location services. 
  
  Bluetooth LE now includes features that enable one device to determine the presence, distance, and direction of 
  another device.
