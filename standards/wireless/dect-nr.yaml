description: |
  DECT NR+ (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications New Radio Plus) is a wireless communication protocol designed 
  to provide reliable, low-latency, and energy-efficient connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. 
  It operates in the unlicensed 1.9 GHz DECT spectrum and is part of the evolving DECT-2020 NR standard, 
  which aligns with 5G requirements.

  DECT NR+ supports ultra-reliable and scalable communication, making it well-suited for industrial IoT applications,
  smart cities, and other large-scale IoT deployments. Its mesh networking capabilities allow devices to act as nodes, 
  enabling extended coverage and robustness in environments with high device densities.
