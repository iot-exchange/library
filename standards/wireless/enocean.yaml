name: EnOcean
description: |
  The EnOcean wireless standard is geared to wireless sensors and wireless sensor networks with ultra-low power
  consumption. It also includes sensor networks that utilize energy harvesting technology to draw energy from their 
  surroundings â€“ for example from motion, light or temperature differences. This principle enables electronic control 
  systems to be used that work independently of an external power supply. 
  
  The EnOcean wireless standard (ISO/ IEC 14543-3-1X) in sub 1GHz is optimized for use in buildings, as a radio range 
  of 30m indoors is possible.
