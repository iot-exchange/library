name: ESP-NOW
description: |
  ESP-NOW is a wireless communication protocol based on the data-link layer, which reduces the five layers of the OSI 
  model to only one. This way, the data need not be transmitted through the network layer, the transport layer, 
  the session layer, the presentation layer, and the application layer. Also, there is no need for packet headers or 
  unpackers on each layer, which leads to a quick response reducing the delay caused by packet loss in congested 
  networks.
