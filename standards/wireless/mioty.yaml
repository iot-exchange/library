description: |
  Mioty is a software based low-power, wide-area network (LPWAN) protocol that was developed to overcome todays and 
  future wireless connectivity limitations. With its best-in-class reliability and scalability, 
  mioty is designed for massive IoT deployments.
  
  Telegrams are split in multiple subpackets which are then transmitted over different frequencies and time. 
  An algorithm in the base station permanently scans the spectrum for mioty sub-packets and reassembles them into a 
  complete message. Due to sophisticated Forward Error Correction (FEC), the receiver only needs 50% of the radio bursts 
  in order to completely reconstruct the information. This reduces the impact of corrupted or lost bursts due to 
  collisions and increases the resistance to interference.
