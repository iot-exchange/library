  #Building the Future of Computing
  Born more than 30 years ago with the goal of designing a computer intended to run on a battery, Arm’s DNA is built 
  around power-efficient CPUs.  Today, Arm compute platforms are the most power-efficient on the planet and continue to 
  push the thresholds of performance to enable the next generation of smart, AI-capable, visually immersive, and 
  increasingly autonomous experiences on everything from the tiniest sensors to the smartphone to the automobile and to 
  the datacenter. This unique combination of performance and efficiency enabled Arm to change the world by fueling the
  smartphone revolution - and it's the reason Arm will power every technology revolution moving forward.
  
  #The World Leader in CPU Technology
  Across industries, Arm technology is building the future of computing. We architect, develop, and license 
  high-performance, low-cost, and energy-efficient IP solutions for CPUs, GPUs, NPUs and interconnect technologies, 
  relied on by many of the world’s leading semiconductor companies and OEMs to develop their products.
  
  In short, Arm licenses the instruction sets for modern chips to partners, who then make chips with customizations for 
  their unique applications. Our trusted computing platforms deliver the right combination of common software standards 
  and foundational hardware building blocks, giving our partners unmatched flexibility in bringing innovative, 
  specialized processing to their products while enabling differentiation where it truly matters.
