    While studying computer science at Ghent university in Belgium Daan Pape started developing the DPT-Module and
    DPT-Board early in 2014. In the summer of 2014 the company DPTechnics was officially started a crowdfunding campaign
    to get the hardware into mass production. The funding was a success and the DPT-Board was shipped all over the world.
  
    We immediately realized the full potential of the Internet-of-Things and focused on creating an IoT based on smart
    devices and not a smart cloud. Therefore we worked more than 2 years in perfecting the architecture of the
    BlueCherry.io cloud and in the meanwhile the first projects were built.
  
    The first projects of DPTechnics were released on the market early 2016 and they were a great success for us and our
    customers. Since then DPTechnics is growing every day and we now are a team with multiple experts on embedded
    programming, GUI design, IoT techniques and business development.
    We now specialize in IoT hardware development and continuously work on the BlueCherry platform to make it even better.
  
    For DPTechnics openess and honesty are esteemed values. We are convinced that this approach is essential
    to develop sustainable high quality products.
