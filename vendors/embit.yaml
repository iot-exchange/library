  Being born as an academic spin-off of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Embit became a company in 2004, 
  with an aim to act as a bridge between university research and local industries.

  This academic footprint has always allowed us to invest in research and innovation since the dawn of the IoT, in order 
  to bring these ideas into reality. Over time, the ideas turned into practical solutions that bring about a remarkable 
  contribution into industrial market.

  RF embedded micro systems has been the backbone of our entire research and design activities. If in academic studies, 
  they were described as a technology of the future, with us, they not only have become a reality but also the core 
  business of our company.
