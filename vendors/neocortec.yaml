  NeoCortec was founded in 2007 with the aim of developing and patenting several innovations related to Wireless Sensor 
  Networks. The founders realized early on that there was a lack of new thinking and research in the area of Wireless 
  Sensor Networks – seemingly all efforts hitherto were based on methods related to IP protocols. 
  
  The founders had maintained that IP protocols were not applicable to the field of Wireless Sensor Networks. 
  They claimed that there existed the possibility of making large scale routing protocols function in real time, 
  thus without network managers etc., and all the while dramatically reducing power consumption.

  Therefore, today, NeoCortec is a supplier of the world’s smallest ultra-low-power bi-directional wireless mesh 
  network modules. The modules come with the proprietary NeoCortec Protocol Stack, which is the result of the research 
  and development activities during the early phase of the company.NeoCortec is based in Copenhagen, Denmark, and 
  Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand. 
  
  NeoCortec is owned by the Danish Private Capital Fund, A/S Holger Petersen Holding. 
  A/S Holger Petersen Holding has achieved an AAA credit rating from Dun & Bradstreet.
